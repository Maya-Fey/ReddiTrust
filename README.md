**This application is no longer in development**

ReddiTrust was made back during the /u/spez drama when they edited a few comments. The idea of this application was to verify comments using public-key cryptography. 

An initial prototype was developed as a javascript bookmarklet which allowed for signing and verifying both comments and text posts. However, due to lack of interest, a final version of the application as a browser plugin was not developed.

The bookmarklet doesn't have any security vulnerabilities with respect to signing, however requiring manual input of keys or using local storage is obviously not practical or secure. This application page is left up mainly for posterity, it should never be used for any purpose.
